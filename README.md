# gotodo

**gotodo** is a simple SPA to demo how to use several different technologies together in a single project. 

The backend Web API was developed with Go which implemented the CRUD in REST. It used the in memory object and didn't have a persistent data store. The frontend was developed with React and Antd. It fetches data from the backend. 

The app can be deployed to a web server directly, containerized in a docker image, or deployed to a Kubernetes cluster.
